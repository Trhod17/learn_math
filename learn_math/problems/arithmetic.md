# Arithmetic
In the solutions directory use the file named **arithmetic.py** and in that file build out the 4 methods called: 
**addition()**, **subtraction()**, **multiplication()**, and **division()** to perform their associated mathematical
purpose.

The 4 methods need to accept a string of numbers (limited to the Integers and/or Floats) that will do the assigned action
to those number in the order they are represented.  For example: Subtract [5, 3, -6, 10] yields -2.

Use the [arithmetic.py](../solutions/arithmetic.py) as a template for your solution file.  This template also includes 
some sample lists as variables for each of the 4 methods.

Note:  At this level of programming we are not going to worry ourselves about non-(Integers/Floats) and we are not going
to handle the "divide by 0" issue either.
