# Learn Math via Python Programming
The goal of this project is fairly straight forward.  Build a set of tools that can be used to teach mathematics by
programming the "problems" in Python.

"Why?", you might ask.  Well, like writing in cursive, the ability to pencil out a long math problem is of little use
in this day and age.  To add fuel to the fire most work situations that require some mathematics are done using a computer
instead of a pencil, yet we are only teaching "programming a computer" to a sub-selection of users who actually need the
skills.

The impetus to this project came when I learned that stock brokers were ditching MS Excel and moving to Python to do their
mathematical computations.  I was already aware that the scientific sector was sprinting towards Python but to hear about
that same journey being taking by "business people" meant it is time to bring programming to whomever might use mathematics.

## Goals
1.  Starting with basic arithmetic, build a set of simple methods to do the "basic calculator" functions.
2.  Build "frameworks" or "templates" of methods that contain setup features (like importing a yaml file with the sample
set of problems) so that a beginner programmer can focus on coding the "math" part of the problem and work into the
"programming" part.
3.  For each method write a unittest that covers expected outcomes and expected errors (like dividing by 0).
4.  Continue up the mathematics ladder by going into Algebra, Trigonometry, etc.

## Stretch Goals
1.  Write sample problems.
2.  Build CICD style infrastructure to fix bug and/or add features automatically to existing implementations of this
project.

## How to help
1.  Fork this project and help me develop it!
2.  Write sample problems and send them to me:  learnmath(at)daxm(dot)net
3.  Find a way for me to do this as a fully time gig.  (I do mean it.  I'd love to transition to a teaching position as a
2nd career.)
4.  Either be a user (or find users) to use this project.
